# Spatial Genomics Reports: Hi-C and Slide-seq

This repository presents two comprehensive reports exploring foundational advancements in spatial genomics technologies: **Hi-C** and **Slide-seq**. These techniques offer powerful insights into gene regulation and cellular architecture by capturing spatial context in the genome and transcriptome.

## ðŸ“˜ Projects Overview

### ðŸ”· Hi-C: Engineering Advancements in 3D Genomics
Hi-C is a groundbreaking genome-wide chromosome conformation capture method that maps the three-dimensional structure of chromatin. This report reviews the methodology behind Hi-C, its evolution from 3C/4C/5C, and its applications in cancer biology and neurodegenerative disease research. The report is complemented by a visual summary in the form of a video presentation.

### ðŸ”¶ Slide-seq: An Advancement in Spatial Transcriptomics
Slide-seq enables high-resolution spatial transcriptomic profiling by preserving tissue structure and mapping gene expression at the cellular level. This report details the Slide-seq workflow, its integration of histology and NGS, and its utility in identifying spatially regulated cell populations.
